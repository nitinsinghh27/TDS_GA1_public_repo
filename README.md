# Project Documentation

This repository contains a project with both Node.js and Python components.

## Node.js Application

This project uses Node.js and npm for package management.

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

For development, you can use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Python Application

The Python part of this project uses dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

To install the Python dependencies, it is recommended to first create a virtual environment. Then, you can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

The dependencies suggest this might be a FastAPI application. To run it, you would typically use `uvicorn`. You will need to replace `main:app` with the actual filename and FastAPI app instance name.

```bash
# Example: uvicorn main:app --reload
uvicorn <your_main_file>:<your_app_instance> --reload
```
